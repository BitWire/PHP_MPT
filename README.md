# The Modern Portfolio Theory

This is a PHP implementation of the Modern Portfolio Theory. I made this as part of a Seminar essay and presentation.
This Project is based on Laravel 5.8 and PHP 7.1 and the medium articles about the MPT by Bernard Brenyah. 
Really worth a read! 

- [Markowitzâ€™s Efficient Frontier in Python [Part 1/2]](https://medium.com/python-data/effient-frontier-in-python-34b0c3043314)

## Installation

In root directory:
```
composer install
```

The `.env.example` to `.env` and app key generation should be done automatically.
Edit the `.env` File to your needs. Dont forget to input an APIKEY!

## Usage
Start the debugserver with the command `php artisan serve` in the root directory of the Project.

In a browser, open: 

```
127.0.0.1:8000/?stocks=XXX,XXX,XXX,XXX
```
where XXX is a valid stock symbol. you can use up to 5 stocks. Optionally you can use timeseries to change the requested data between monthly adjusted (monthly) and daily adjusted (daily) stock prices. This defaults to daily.
